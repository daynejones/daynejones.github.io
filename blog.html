      <h3>Blog</h3>
      <p>I am a full stack engineer that leans slightly toward the front end. I design and build a wide range of applications, tools, and games for Livingly Media Inc and many others for my various side endeavors. Sometimes that means implementing a new javascript framework and building an API, sometimes coding up a webpage from a mockup, and sometimes it's designing and implementing sensical and performant data models.</p>
      <p>My favorite languages to work with are <b>Javascript, HTML5, CSS3, SQL, PHP, Python, and Ruby</b>. On top of these languages, I love working with <b>Backbone, Angular, Django, Rails, Git, Docker, Unix, MongoDB, Node, Bootstrap and the Bourbon family</b> though I'm always testing out the latest technology in my spare time.</p>
      <p>I am opinionated about writing code that is readable, well commented, and full of helpful variable and function names. Performant systems with extensive testing make me incredibly happy. When the browser is involved, cross-platform compatibility is my top priority.</p>
      <p>When I'm not writing code for Livingly, I'm writing code or DIYs for <a href="http://howchoo.com">Howchoo.com</a>. When I'm not doing that, I'm learning the latest new framework or language. When I'm not doing that, I'm probably hiking, reading, making coffee, or with my amazing family.</p>
